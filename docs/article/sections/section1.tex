\section{Introduction}

Airflow condition around the airfoil is an essential component in aircraft development. The airflow will affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the wing and even the whole aircraft. Therefore, the knowledge of airfoil aerodynamics and boundary layer theory is necessary for understanding the airfoil design \cite{eppler2012airfoil}.

Using the generalized method to gather airfoil aerodynamics data from wind tunnel tests is still used to obtain design certification. Nevertheless, using the wind tunnel to study airfoil aerodynamics needs more expense.
